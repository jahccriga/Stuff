Ok here's some keywords for you:

#3: "stealth.context.Base" or "stealth.context.<contextGroup>"
#4:
 {
            serverUrl:                  ${com.ccri.onethresher.env.configured-services.arc-gis.world-url},
            xyz:                        true,
            Name:                       "esri:world_imagery",
            Title:                      "World Imagery",
            originalProjection:         "EPSG:3857",
            tileSize:                   512,
            wrapX:                      true,
            minZoom:                    0,
            maxZoom:                    21,
            KeywordList:                ["stealth.context.Base"],
            queryable:                  false
        },
I think I know what you mean for #2, but I'm not sure how to disable it. It might help if I knew what baseball card template you're using? I'll try to look around.
